To check status of your job, run (for example): squeue –user=sotiriaboutsi –long\nsh my_script.sh (for a usual script run)\n\nIf you are working on a Mac OS, use this command when downloading through url links instead of the wget command:\n\ncurl -O url.link\n\nIf you have the programs already installed, feel free to adjust your code to simplify the script.\nTo ensure your scripts are executable, change the permissions by running: chmod a+x script.sh\nAlways check the terminal output (or slurm-job.out file)!\nStacks is very tricky to install in a Mac. You might want to consider doing the analysis in a Linux environment instead.\n\nexample script"
